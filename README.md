# Android MediaPipe Pose Classifier

A slightly modified version of MediaPipe Tasks Pose Landmark Detection Android Demo repo that I took and add in the function to classify poses using Neural Network.

Things that I changed from the original repo :
- Uses only the Lite task version
- Added text-to-speech function for the pose results, and on-screen text results too
- Neural Network implementation for pose classification
- Removes the Gallery window

Everything else is left as is.
